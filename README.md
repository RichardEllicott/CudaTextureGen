# CUDA Hello World

This is a minimal CUDA + C++ project that demonstrates a simple GPU kernel launch.
Written on WSL using Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS

## Structure

- `src/main.cu`: CUDA kernel and host code
- `BUILD.sh`: Build script using Make
- `BUILD_NINJA.sh`: Build script using Ninja
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Simple CMake configuration

## Build Instructions

```bash
./BUILD.sh
```


## Notes

adding python



sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev


sudo apt install python3.12-dev




okay it seems we're working but i likely forgot dependancies, we now have a python hook not yet linked by hello world from each
